The SPARKATHON repository welcomes you!  Specifically, this project was made for the **WALMART SPARKATHON**.  
"Reimagining customer experience" is the concept we have been working on, 
and our primary goal has been to develop a web application that would enhance the user experience and facilitate offline shopping.

## About

The main goal of the SMORTMART project is to greatly simplify in-store purchasing for consumers.
These consumers can create a bar code within the app and add things to their lists or carts via the web app, making it simple to navigate the supermarket.
Essentially, the project assists the consumer or user in locating items within the shop and identifying the aisle and shelf in which the item is located without the assistance of employees.
Additionally, it simplifies the billing process by enabling users to scan the barcode, pay, and leave without having to wait for each product to be scanned individually.

## Features

üõí *Add to Cart Button*

Users can add items to a virtual cart.
Cart data is stored using LocalStorage, so items persist even on page reloads.

üì¶ *Cart Page with Item Display*

Dedicated "My Cart" page that displays all selected items.
Dynamically renders product names, prices, and total items in the cart.

üß† *Shelf Visualization System*

Items are mapped to specific shelf locations (A‚ÄìI).
Helps simulate the physical placement of products inside a supermarket layout.

üî¢ *Barcode Generation*

Unique barcodes are generated for each item using a barcode library (like JsBarcode).
Barcodes are rendered visually and can be printed or scanned.

üìä *Interactive Layout Mapping*

The shelf map system visually organizes items by their section/shelf.
Useful for simulating real-world product placement and navigation in a smart store.

üìÅ *Modular Design with Asset Separation*

Clean separation of HTML, CSS, JS files for better project organization.
